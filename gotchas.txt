List of gotchas I can remember:
Lambda@edge doesn't support environment variables..
Adding multiple principals to auth lambda role was a pain.
Lambdas triggered by cloudfront have a size limit of 1048576 - needed to 'rejigger' imports - can fix this by adding 'exclude' to cdk code to remove node modules.
With above - exclude is now depreciated... not sure how to resolve this.
Can't use encrypted parameter store parameters with CDK
Lamdba@edge must be in us-east-1
