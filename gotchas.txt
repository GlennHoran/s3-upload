List of gotchas I can remember:
Lambda@edge doesn't support environment variables..
Adding multiple principals to auth lambda role was a pain.
Lambdas triggered by cloudfront have a size limit of 1048576 - needed to 'rejigger' imports
Can't use encrypted parameter store parameters with CDK
Lamdba@edge must be in us-east-1
