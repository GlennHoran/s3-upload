Gotchas, Learnings & Rationale

List of gotchas I can remember:
Lambda@edge doesn't support environment variables..
Adding multiple principals to auth lambda role was a pain.
Lambdas triggered by cloudfront have a size limit of 1048576 - needed to 'rejigger' imports - can fix this by adding 'exclude' to cdk code to remove node modules.
With above - exclude is now depreciated... not sure how to resolve this.
Can't use encrypted parameter store parameters with CDK
Lamdba@edge must be in us-east-1

Rationale:
Presigned URL - no 6mb payload limit on lambda payloads (even an API gateway payload has a limit of 10mb).

Weird ass cloud front /path parameters = sent to bucket!

Look up how to use edge lambda to remove file path from request - i,e if I have a path param for cloudfront that looks like:
http://cloudfrontURL/uploads
that redirects to a bucket, then the bucket NEEDS to have that uploads folder in it.
i.e s3//bucketName/uploads/index.html
